# Predicting-Credit-Risk
I predict whether an applicant will pay back their loan or default.

Predicting whether a loan applicant will pay back a loan or default is a common business analytics problem in finance. Banks and lenders traditionally use credit scoring systems to decide whom to lend to. I build a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras to predict credit risk (loan default) in a finance context. I perform data preprocessing, define a neural network model, train it, and evaluate its performance.
